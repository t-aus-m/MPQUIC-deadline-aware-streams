                   Deadline Aware Streams in MP-QUIC
         draft-tjohn-quic-mpquic-deadline-aware-streams-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes the Deadline-aware Multipath Transport
   Protocol (DMTP) as an extension to the Multipath Extension of QUIC.
   DMTP leverages multiple paths along adaptive Forward Error Correction
   (FEC) and smart retransmissions to support real-time applications
   with strict latency requirements.  With this it fills in a niche with
   increasing demand, that existing multipath protocols fall short on.

1.  Introduction //: # TODO: Rephrase to reflect DMTP as a whole

   Deadline-aware streams allow applications to specify deadlines for
   data transmission on specific streams.  This enables the transport
   layer to make scheduling and retransmission decisions that aim to
   meet these deadlines, optimizing for latency-sensitive applications.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Motivation //: # TODO: Rephrase to reflect DMTP as a whole

   The Multipath Extension of QUIC [MP-QUIC] enhances performance by
   utilizing multiple paths simultaneously, but it currently lacks
   mechanisms to guarantee data delivery within specific timeframes.
   Given the increasing demand for real-time applications such as
   teleoperation, live video streaming, and online gaming there's a
   growing need for transport protocols that can efficiently handle
   strict latency requirements.  Introducing deadline-aware streams to
   [MP-QUIC] could enable applications to meet those stringent latency
   constraints, optimizing for low-latency and high-reliability
   scenarios.

   Additionally, the ability to have multiple paths using the same
   4-tuple opens up the possibility of leveraging paths from path-aware
   networks like SCION, source routing, and others.  This expands the
   pool of available paths beyond traditional IPv4 and IPv6 routes,
   potentially increasing the effectiveness of deadline-aware mechanisms
   like those proposed in the Deadline-aware Multipath Transport
   Protocol [DMTP].

   While the implementation of deadline-aware streams with
   implementation-specific APIs is of course possible, that approach
   would likely lack endpoint coordination, because deadlines would not
   be communicated between different through the protocol.  By
   introducing a transport parameter (see Section 5.1) and a custom
   frame (see Section 5.2), endpoints can negotiate support and exchange
   deadline information directly within the protocol, enabling
   coordinated scheduling decisions at the transport layer.
   Standardizing this mechanism avoids the limitations of
   implementation-specific solutions, promoting wider adoption and
   interoperability of deadline-aware streams across different
   implementations of [MP-QUIC].

4.  Design of DMTP

4.1.  Custom Scheduler and Congestion Controller for Deadline-Aware
      Streams

   Implementations that support deadline-aware streams SHOULD provide a
   custom scheduler and congestion controller that prioritize packets
   based on their deadlines.  This includes:

   *  Path Selection: Dynamically selecting paths that are most likely
      to meet the deadlines based on real-time metrics like latency,
      bandwidth, and packet loss.

   *  Packet Prioritization: Prioritizing packets from streams with
      earlier deadlines.

   *  Adaptive Retransmissions: Deciding whether to retransmit lost
      packets based on their remaining time before the deadline.

   *  Forward Error Correction (FEC): Optionally integrating FEC
      mechanisms to reduce the need for retransmissions in networks with
      random losses.

   *  Deadline Miss Handling: Informing the application when a deadline
      cannot be met, allowing it to take appropriate action.

4.2.  Deadlines

4.2.1.  Signalling Deadlines

   To signal deadlines, endpoints use the DEADLINE_CONTROL frame (see
   Section 5.2).  This frame associates a specific deadline with a
   stream, indicating the relative time by which the data should be
   delivered.

4.2.2.  Deadline Semantics

   *  Deadline Representation: Deadlines are represented as a relative
      time in milliseconds from the time the frame is sent.

   *  Stream Association: A deadline applies to a specific stream
      identified by its Stream ID

   *  Transport Behavior: Upon receiving a DEADLINE_CONTROL frame, the
      transport layer SHOULD attempt to schedule and retransmit packets
      carrying data for the specified stream to meet the indicated
      deadline.

   *  Retransmissions and Scheduling: Endpoints MAY implement custom
      schedulers and congestion controllers optimized for deadline-aware
      traffic, such as those based on DMTP concepts.

4.2.3.  Handling Missed Deadline

   If the transport layer determines that the deadline cannot be met, it
   MAY choose to:

   *  Discard the data associated with the deadline-aware stream.

   *  Inform the application of the missed deadline.

   *  Continue delivering the data if it is still deemed useful.

   The specific behavior is implementation-specific and MAY be
   configurable by the application.

4.3.  Adaptive Forward Error Correction (FEC)

   DMTP optionally uses Adaptive FEC as proposed in [QUIC-AFEC] to
   reduce the need for retransmissions in networks with random losses.
   When using [QUIC-AFEC], the Tag Type of the FEC_Tag MUST be set to 1
   in order for the FEC to work in a [MP-QUIC] and DMTP environment.
   FEC Packets SHOULD be sent via another path then the source data, it
   is however RECOMMENDED to send the FEC data via the retransmission
   path.

4.4.  Smart Retransmissions

5.  Extension of Multipath Extension of QUIC

   This extension is based on and aims to extend [MP-QUIC].  The
   contents of this extension will be specified in this section.

5.1.  Handshake Negotiation and Transport Parameter

   This extension defines a new transport parameter, used to negotiate
   the use of deadline-aware streams during the connection handshake, as
   specified in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  The new transport parameter is
   defined as follows:

   *  enable_deadline_aware_streams (value TBD): A zero-length value
      that, if present, indicates that the endpoint supports deadline-
      aware streams.

   Endpoints negotiate the use of deadline-aware streams by including
   the enable_deadline_aware_streams transport parameter in the
   handshake.  Both endpoints MUST include this transport parameter to
   enable the use of deadline-aware streams.  If an endpoint receives a
   DEADLINE_CONTROL frame without having negotiated support, it MUST
   treat this as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION

5.2.  DEADLINE_CONTROL Frame

   The DEADLINE_CONTROL frame (type=TBD) is used to signal deadline-
   awareness for specific streams and to indicate their associated
   deadlines.

     DEADLINE_CONTROL Frame {
       Type (i) = TBD,
       Stream ID (i),
       Deadline (i),
     }

   The DEADLINE_CONTROL frame contains the following fields:

   Stream ID:  A variable-length integer indicating the Stream ID to
      which the deadline applies.

   Deadline:  A variable-length integer representing the relative
      deadline in milliseconds from the time the frame is sent.  An
      endpoint sends a DEADLINE_CONTROL frame to indicate that data on
      the specified stream should be delivered by the given deadline.
      Upon receiving this frame, the peer MUST attempt to schedule and
      deliver the data on the specified stream within the indicated
      deadline.

   Usage Constraints:

   *  Endpoints MUST NOT send the DEADLINE_CONTROL frame unless both
      endpoints have negotiated support via the
      enable_deadline_aware_streams transport parameter.

   *  If an endpoint receives a DEADLINE_CONTROL frame without having
      negotiated support, it MUST treat it as a connection error of type
      PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

   *  The DEADLINE_CONTROL frame MUST only be sent in 1-RTT packets.

6.  API

7.  Security Considerations

   This extension retains all the security features and considerations
   of [QUIC-TRANSPORT], [QUIC-TLS] and [MP-QUIC].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new transport parameter for the negotiation
   of enable multiple paths for QUIC, and three new frame types.  The
   draft defines provisional values for experiments, but we expect IANA
   to allocate short values if the draft is approved.

   The following entry in Table 1 should be added to the "QUIC Transport
   Parameters" registry under the "QUIC Protocol" heading.

         +=======+===============================+===============+
         | Value | Parameter Name.               | Specification |
