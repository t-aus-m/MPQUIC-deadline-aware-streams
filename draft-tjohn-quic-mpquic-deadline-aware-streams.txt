                   Deadline Aware Streams in MP-QUIC
         draft-tjohn-quic-mpquic-deadline-aware-streams-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes deadline aware streams to be added to
   Multipath QUIC in order to be able to deliver deadline sensitive
   information via QUIC over multiple paths.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Extension of [MP-QUIC]

3.1.  Handshake Negotiation and Transport Parameter

   This extension defines a new transport parameter, used to negotiate
   the use of deadline-aware streams during the connection handshake, as
   specified in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  The new transport parameter is
   defined as follows:

   *  enable_deadline_aware_streams (value TBD): A zero-length value
      that, if present, indicates that the endpoint supports deadline-
      aware streams.

   Endpoints negotiate the use of deadline-aware streams by including
   the enable_deadline_aware_streams transport parameter in the
   handshake.  Both endpoints MUST include this transport parameter to
   enable the use of deadline-aware streams.  If an endpoint receives a
   DEADLINE_CONTROL frame without having negotiated support, it MUST
   treat this as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION
